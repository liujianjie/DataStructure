I have a good friend, 
and her name is Li Mei. 
We know each other about two years. 
When I am in trouble, 
she helps me without 
hesitation. So I will 
also help her when
she meets difficulty. 
We share our secrets 
and sometimes she will stay the night
with me. We will talk 
very happily and go 
to sleep very late.
We are always told 
that time is precious so that we shall cherish it. Even though 
most of us know the 
necessity of making 
use of time, when we 
start our plans, we 
find that time is 
limited. Where has 
the time gone, we always feel confused about 
it. Actually, it 
is the lack of efficiency that makes people feel time is not enough. 
It is in need of 
improving efficiency. Most students can't focus their mind on study 
because they think of 
all kinds of temptations, such as delicious food and computer 
games. If they can 
finish task quickly, 
then they can do other things. It is the 
motivation to improve efficiency.
